# xkcd-background
A small Python project that pulls comics from xkcd.com.
## WARNING ⚠️
I did not make XKCD or any of its comics, and I know that some of the comics are NSFW. Use with caution. Or at least, don't sue me or anything.

## About
This is a Python program that downloads XKCD images, resizes them to the size of a standard desktop wallpaper, and optionally inverts the colour for dark mode users.
## Requirements
 - Python
 - requests (```pip install requests```)
 - Pillow (```pip install Pillow```)
 - Storage space
 - Time/patience
## How to use
Just run it on Python. It will prompt for the first comic and last comic you want (inclusive) and light/dark mode. Then just let it download. Depending on how many you want this could take a while.
