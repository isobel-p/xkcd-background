## About
This is a Python program that downloads XKCD images, resizes them to the size of a standard desktop wallpaper, and optionally inverts the colour for dark mode users. Made for Hack Club High Seas.
### What is XKCD?
As told by AI:
> XKCD is a webcomic created by Randall Munroe that features a blend of humor, science, mathematics, and technology. Launched in 2005, the comic is known for its stick-figure art style and clever commentary on a wide range of topics, including computer programming, relationships, and existential questions. XKCD often incorporates elements of nerd culture and has gained a dedicated following for its insightful and often thought-provoking content. In addition to the comic, Munroe has published books and created projects that further explore themes from the comic, making it a significant part of internet culture.

Just run it on Python. It will prompt for the first comic and last comic you want (inclusive) and light/dark mode. Then just let it download. Depending on how many you want this could take a while.
## WARNING
I did not make XKCD or any of its comics, and I know that some of the first comics are NSFW. Use with caution. Or at least, don't sue me or anything.
Later comics should be fine.
